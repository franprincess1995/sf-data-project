    "### Synopsis\n",
    "\n",
    "The San Francisco Rent Ordinance created the San Francisco Rent Board in 1979. The Board receives petitions from the city's landlords and tenants. In some cases, the Tent Board will oversee a mediation/arbitration session between the complainant and the alleged wrongdoer.  The nature of the petition, of course, varies depending on whom the filing party is, but the Rent Board can only adjudicate issues that are covered in the rent ordinance. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was specifically interested in investigating tenant petitions. In a petition, a tenant can allege one or more complaint, including wrongful eviction, unfair rent increase, a decrease in housing services (necessary repairs and replacements), etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The city of San Francisco keeps a CSV of the petitions sent to the Board going back to January 1997. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Petitions-to-the-Rent-Board/6swy-cmkq\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is \"wide,\" meaning each possible complaint is its own column, and each column contains boolean values: 'True' if the particular complaint is one of the reasons for the petition, and 'False' if not. In addition to those complaint columns, there are several columns important to this analysis, including: \n",
    "\n",
    "* petition_id: unique identifier for each petition\n",
    "* date_filed: when the petition was filed\n",
    "* filing_party: did a tenant or a landlord file the petition?\n",
    "* neighborhoods: in which neighborhood does the petitioner live? \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that's critical to understand is that each row refers to one petition. But a single petition can include several complaints (according to the SF Rent Board website: \"The tenant may combine more than one type of claim in a Tenant Petition\").\n",
    "\n",
    "I will analyze petitions submitted by tenants from 2010 to present. I ask the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* In which year did tenants file the most petitions?\n",
    "* What kinds of complaints are the most popular? \n",
    "* From which neighborhoods did most complaints arise? And how does the number of complaints compare to the population of renters in each neighborhood? \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is divided into two notebooks. One focused on data preparation and another focused on analysis. Both can be found in the notebooks subfolder. My findings are located in the analysis notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "I prepare the analyze the data in order of the questions above. \n"

    "* More than 1,900 complaints were leveled at landlords in 2015, making it the year that saw the highest number of complaints. 2014 was not far behind, with just 30 fewer complaints. In 2014, there were several news reports about record-breaking rent prices for one-bedrooms in San Francisco. According to Business Insider, which cites an analysis conducted by real estate website Zumper, rent for a one-bedroom in 2014 rose 13.5% city-wide. In some neighborhoods, rent for a one-bedroom rose as much as 30%. It makes sense that increasing rent would lead to more complaints: Tenants might have been surprised by the amount they'd have to spend in 2014 versus 2013, and they might have seen a quality of apartment maintenance that didn't correspond with the new, higher rent they were paying. \n",

    "* 2020 and 2021 saw the fewest amount of complaints. There are several factors that could explain why years characterized by financial strife and longer hours at home didn't correlate with more complaints from tenants. According to data from the California Policy Lab, San Francisco saw a decrease in population in 2020. That's the first time that's happened since 2016, when CA Policy Lab started collecting data. According to a SF Chronicle analysis of the data: \"the number of Californians leaving the state for other parts of the country has increased, while the number of people moving into the state from the rest of the U.S. has decreased.\" Fewer people means less competition for apartments and lower rents. According to data from ApartmentsList cited by SFGate, overall rents in San Francisco dropped more than 26% between March 2020 and January 2021. \n",

    "\n",
    "* The most popular tenant complaint is a decrease in housing services. This means the tenant alleges their landlord decreased necessary maintenance, including repairs and painting, without decreasing their base rent. Petitions alleging a decrease in housing services are essentially pleas to the Rent Board to compel the landlord to decrease the tenant's rent. In order for that to happen, the tenant must prove that they brought the issue to the landlord and the landlord did not change their practices. \n",
    "* The other two prominent types of complaints were those that alleged a wrongful eviction or unlawful rent increase. It's worth noting that while the Rent Board will investigate complaints alleging a wrongful eviction, it cannot decide whether the eviction is legal or not—that's up to the court.   "

This raises a few questions that could guide further reporting on the trend: Could the stay-at-home orders be responsible, in that people were spending more time at their homes and demanded/noticed housing services? Did complaints for housing services consistently come from the same source neighborhood? Are there any similarities between the buildings where complaints about a decrease in housing services came from? Like a similar owner?  "

    "* In 2015, Golden Gate Park had the most complaints per 100 renters. However, the number of complaints from that neighborhood in that year was only 9. What's more interesting is that in Chinatown, which had the third highest amount of complaints in 2015, had a rate of 2.5 complaints per 100 renters. The rate of complaints per 100 renters in Chinatown *decreased* in 2019 to less than one (but keep in mind that the number of complaints in 2019 was lower than in 2015).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2010, tenants filed the most complaints in 2014 and 2015. This correlates with an increase in rent that the city hadn't seen before. Complaints overall decreased to their lowest levels in 2020 and 2021, coinciding with the pandemic and increased housing protections. However, complaints alleging that the landlord decreased housing services stayed relatively stable, while the number of all complaints decreased over time. This could be related to the fact that more people were home and perhaps noticed or demanded more housing services. Overall, most of the tenant complaints since 2010 came from the Mission, but when normalized for the number of renters there in 2015 and 2019, Mission didn't stand out. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Further analysis/reporting**\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd be interested in seeing complaints/number of renters for each year in this interval. Is there a year where a neighborhood with a high number of complaints stood out for its rate? Are the complaints all similar? Do they all come from a specific building? \n",
    "\n",
    "Why did the number of housing services complaints stay steady when the overall number of complaints decreased? How did the rent board handle these complaints, and what was the outcome? Did tenants win lower rents for what they saw as decreased housing services? I'd be especially interested in focusing on housing service complaints that occurred during the pandemic, since, as mentioned before, people were more home for longer periods of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Are the trends similar for complaints from landlords? Do landlord complaints rise in 2015 and decrease after? "

    "### Synopsis\n",
    "\n",
    "The San Francisco Rent Ordinance created the San Francisco Rent Board in 1979. The Board receives petitions from the city's landlords and tenants. In some cases, the Tent Board will oversee a mediation/arbitration session between the complainant and the alleged wrongdoer.  The nature of the petition, of course, varies depending on whom the filing party is, but the Rent Board can only adjudicate issues that are covered in the rent ordinance. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was specifically interested in investigating tenant petitions. In a petition, a tenant can allege one or more complaint, including wrongful eviction, unfair rent increase, a decrease in housing services (necessary repairs and replacements), etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The city of San Francisco keeps a CSV of the petitions sent to the Board going back to January 1997. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Petitions-to-the-Rent-Board/6swy-cmkq\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is \"wide,\" meaning each possible complaint is its own column, and each column contains boolean values: 'True' if the particular complaint is one of the reasons for the petition, and 'False' if not. In addition to those complaint columns, there are several columns important to this analysis, including: \n",
    "\n",
    "* petition_id: unique identifier for each petition\n",
    "* date_filed: when the petition was filed\n",
    "* filing_party: did a tenant or a landlord file the petition?\n",
    "* neighborhoods: in which neighborhood does the petitioner live? \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that's critical to understand is that each row refers to one petition. But a single petition can include several complaints (according to the SF Rent Board website: \"The tenant may combine more than one type of claim in a Tenant Petition\").\n",
    "\n",
    "I will analyze petitions submitted by tenants from 2010 to present. I ask the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* In which year did tenants file the most petitions?\n",
    "* What kinds of complaints are the most popular? \n",
    "* From which neighborhoods did most complaints arise? And how does the number of complaints compare to the population of renters in each neighborhood? \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is divided into two notebooks. One focused on data preparation and another focused on analysis. Both can be found in the notebooks subfolder. My findings are located in the analysis notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this data preparation notebook, I prepare the data in three different chunks. In **Misc,** I import the csv and do a top-level analysis to understand the kind of data I'm working with. In **Filtering,** I whittle the dataframe down to the rows that will help me answer the above questions. In **Melt,** I reshape the data to be more conducive to analysis. "
